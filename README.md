This peoject is fully complete but might not run right since thr package.json and package-lock.json were wrong since I had a problem with my laptop where it stopped working so i was not able to move yhose files from my laptop to there in time. Because of these files being wrong the server file will give an error that the correct modules are not installed, but other than that it should all work.
